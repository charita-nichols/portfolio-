            <p>Hi, I'm Charita, a Web Developer, who resides in the Washington, D.C. area. I have always been interested and amazed by technology, from computers to phones to software. 
                A passion of mine is figuring out how every piece of the puzzle fits to make a whole. I wanted to know what made them work and how I could be part of that world.</p>
            <p>About a year ago, I started looking for ways I could make this a career. I stumbled across coding and web development. 
                I think it's a perfect fit, as I can create software that connects to the technology that I fell in love with growing up.</p>

            <p>With a background as a certified Electronic Sytems Technician, I am no stranger to working on projects. To be apart of a coding team would be no different. 
                Every team member is an asset. I also like to add my artsy flair to my projects by designing fun layouts and eye-pleasing color schemes. 
            </p>
            <p>A passion of mine is figuring out how every piece of the puzzle fits to make a whole.</p>
            <p>If I'm not coding, I am most likely making a playlist (huge music enthusiast), catching up on the
                latest Netflix show, or playing Animal Crossing, on Nintendo Switch</p>

            <p>This app allows users to take a five question test on some of cultures biggest icons, such as Beyonc√©, Dolly Parton, and John Mayer.
